For this Python challenge we will create a statistical simulation program to test the Birthday Paradox. Our aim is to determine whether the actual probabilities match the predicted probabilities by showing that, with a group of 23 students or more, the probability of having at least two students sharing the same birthday will be at least 50%.
Our program will:

1.Generate a class list of students (e.g. 23 students or more)
2.Use a randomDate() function to generate random birthdays for each of our students
3.Store the lists of birthdays in a list
4. Output the list of students with their randomly generated birthdays

lets code the first step:
```python
import random


# Import the random and string modules
import random
import string

# Define a function to generate a random name of a given length
def generate_name(length):
  # Initialize an empty string to store the name
  name = ""

  # Loop for length times
  for i in range(length):
    # Randomly choose a letter from the alphabet
    letter = random.choice(string.ascii_letters)

    # Append the letter to the name
    name += letter

  # Return the name
  return name

# Ask the user for the number of students to generate
num_students = int(input("How many students do you want to generate?"))

# Initialize an empty list to store the students
students = []

# Loop for num_students times
for i in range(num_students):
  # Randomly choose a length between 3 and 10 for the first name and the last name
  first_name_length = random.randint(3, 10)
  last_name_length = random.randint(3, 10)

  # Generate a random first name and a random last name using the function
  first_name = generate_name(first_name_length)
  last_name = generate_name(last_name_length)

  # Concatenate the first name and the last name with a space
  full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

  # Append the full name to the students list
  students.append(full_name)

# Print the students list
print(students)
```
